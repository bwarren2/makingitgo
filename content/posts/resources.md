I've found a few useful things on my journey.

#### [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

A handy reference progression of annotated samples.

#### [Exercism Go Track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/go)

An old standard.  Very nice to do while you are waiting for something to compile.

#### [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list)

More annotated samples.

#### [The Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/maps)
With reference on some core types, among other things.


#### [Go Design Patterns](https://www.godesignpatterns.com/)

More advanced idiomatic patterns.

#### [What are Goroutines?](https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/how-goroutines-work/#:~:text=The%20creation%20of%20a%20goroutine,freeing%20heap%20storage%20as%20required.&text=Threads%20on%20the%20other%20hand,one%20thread's%20memory%20and%20another.)

How one of the core features of Go works.


#### [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

Official docs on what makes good Go.
